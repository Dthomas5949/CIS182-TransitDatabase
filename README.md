# CIS182-TransitDatabase
This is a database I made in SQL for a transit company. 
"Homework2": The main query where I make the database. 
"Homework4": Where I use SELECT statements to search for certain entries, and using FROM, and WHERE.
"Homework5": Where I use SELECT statements, but this time I use OUTER, LEFT, and RIGHT joins.
"Homework6": Where I use subqueries to get the entries that im looking for.
